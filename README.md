# Willett Time

These calculations are the accompaniment to my [blog post](TODO: link)
on Daylight Saving Time.

[This pdf](https://github.com/astahlman/willet-time/blob/master/core.pdf)
shows the full derivations related to the clocks and charts,
implemented in ClojureScript. The content of the .pdf are exported
from .org as LaTeX and converted to .pdf using pdf2latex.
